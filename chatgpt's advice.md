Adding a Fight Sequence to a Command Line Input Game
To add a fight sequence to a command line input game, you will need to follow these steps:

Determine the mechanics of the fight sequence. Will it be turn-based or real-time? How will the player and the opponent attack and defend? Will there be any special abilities or items that can be used?

Create the necessary variables to track the state of the fight. These might include the player's and opponent's health points, any special abilities or items that are available, and the current turn or phase of the fight.

Write the code that handles the player's input during the fight. This might involve accepting commands like "attack," "defend," or "use item," and updating the game state accordingly.

Write the code that handles the opponent's actions. This might involve randomly selecting an attack or defense move, or implementing a set of AI rules to determine the opponent's actions.

Implement the logic for determining the outcome of the fight. This might involve subtracting damage from the player's or opponent's health points based on the attacks and defenses used, and checking for win or loss conditions.

Display the current state of the fight to the player, including the health points of the player and the opponent, and any special abilities or items that are available.

Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the fight is over, either because the player or the opponent has been defeated, or because the player has chosen to flee or otherwise end the fight.

It's a good idea to test your fight sequence thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning as intended. You may also want to consider adding additional features, such as the ability to use special abilities or items, or to heal during the fight.
