Hm, So We Begin. There are 5 Main Module Variables.

-   Money
-   Experience
-   Armor
-   Weapon
-   Health

These are the things that make you be better in the game.

Money
-----

the most important thing, because it helps you buy 3 main modules, **armor, weapon & health.** there can be two ways to earn money:

### How To Earn Money

### way 1: work

can't seem to find a way to add interactive work, it should be a CLI based, cant edit and shit. life's so full of disappointment

### way 2: search

given 3 places, 11% chance that you actually lose money.

### Introducing In-Game-Shop

This thing lets you buy things by investing money in it. very original.

Armor And Health
----------------

### Health

*So This Is Related to Some Complex Maths Trust Me, You Will Understand!*

### body mass index relation

Ever Heard About this Term called BMI? It's Like a calculation metric to understand how healthy is your body based on yur height and weight. (so, for people who use pound and feet-inches, gfy, im not going to calculate that shit for you, LEARN METRIC!) So For The Good Lads That Use Metric, The Formula for BMI is$BodyMassIndex=kg/(height^2)$

so, if your bmi is more than 25, you're statistically fat, and if your bmi is less than 19, you're statistically a stick. the perfect bmi is around 21-22. if you have a bmi in that range, you get 1.5 extra health points, its literally based on Charles Darwin's theory of "survival of the fittest"

Now, Health is needed to well, live? your health points determine how stronger you are, you can become stronger from the tyrannical bosses in fights.

### Earn Health:

You Can Buy Healthy Foods To Increase Your Health. Very Original. eitherwise, you can do workout, this is less very original.

**Workout**

3 Questions About Health, Numerical Based, Each 5p If All Correct, Give 5p Extra. 20p = +2hp | 10p = +1hp | 5p = +0.5hp

---5 Minute Cooldown---

### **Armor**

Armor, The Classical Artificial Addition.

Armor is needed to fight bosses, cuz you gotta have a protection man, you cant go to a war wearing tank top, the in-game-shop sells armor points.

### Armor Formulae-ee-eee

Trigger Warning: Complex Maths Armor Can Be Bought From the In-Game Store From The Money You Have. trust me it works...

The Formula for Armor Advantage is: $Armor**(1.25)+health= new health$

** is the operator for '^' or exponents. therefore, if Armor = 16 and health = 64 armor^1.25=16^1.25= 32

64+32 = 96 = new health while fighting bosses

Weapon
------

you need to stab ~~in-game-orphans~~ right, therefore you need a good weapon, to, well, stab. We Don't sell weapons, we sell weapon points, **YOUR FINGERS ARE YOUR WEAPONS**, we just upgrade your weapons to better weapons, as if like a metal pen as a finger. haha enough of that

### Weapon Formulae

$Weapon*(-3/4) = damage$

$health - damage = new health$

Your Weapon Points are multiplied by (-3/4) and that is the damage,

if health (armor combined) = 64, and weapon = 16, It Will Take 5.33 Average No-Luck Hits To KEAL

Experience.
-----------

> I've had an experience for 40 years, of living on this planet

-   bill gates said this when he turned 40 years old

Experience, is needed to fight with bosses, if you don't have experience, no one cares about you, i feel sad for you, but you don't have any experience, so i don't care about you, you'll get experience for grinding commands and all. yeah thats pretty much it.

Why? How? What Next? and help.
==============================

### hmm

After completing charc, I would be burned out as usual, but by Committing To Charc, I have kind of stopped procrastinating, that's because making a game isnt that great of a thing, however, it keeps the dopamine and all in control, therefore, this is a great thing.

Now, I have completed 5 days of coding on charc, and developing it, donating over 50+ hours to this project. I'll try making videos on these things next, however, I need 2 main things for the last 2 days.

-   Fight() Logic, Players need a way to fight with their bosses, how i make that in a CLI based CUI? idk pls help
-   Interactive work() ideas. How Do I make interactions in CLI, pls help.

suggest me some projects if you want to, i'm running out of ideas to live on.
